Hi im ByHollow and i'm learning how to use Github and python, just to enter the programming world.

I'm just learning how to interact with others people projects and upload mi branch with some new usefull stuff, i hope it doesn't bother you in any way possible im just learning this World :D

i will try to push this branch to your depo as "update" just to test if it works how i learn it, if it doesn'w works, i will be so sad
